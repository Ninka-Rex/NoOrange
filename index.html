        <br><br><h1 style="font-size: 60px;">üü† No Orange!</h1>
        <p><b>Please don't use the orange status on VRChat.</b></p>
		<p>Instead, change your status to something more clear and respectful!</p><br>
		
		<h1 style="color: #333333; font-size: 45px;">Why no orange?</h1>

        <h2><strong>Orange does not signal your true availability.</strong></h2>
        <p>Unlike other statuses, It is confusing and inconsistent, as some people use it as a way to signal that they are busy or prefer not to be disturbed, while others use it as a way to filter who can join them or just to be aware of who is joining them. This can lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities with people who want to interact with you.</p>

        <h2>Orange wastes others' time.</h2>
        <p>Being on orange is disheartening to other users who want to join you. It can cause people to request invite over and over again, hoping that you will accept them. They could also get invited but not want to go once they find out where you are. This can waste their time, energy, and bandwidth, as well as make them feel unwanted or rejected by waiting for an invite that will never come.</p>

        <h2>Orange makes you unapproachable.</h2>
        <p>It makes you look like you don‚Äôt want to be bothered which can deter other users from trying to contact you.  It also makes your friends feel annoying for constantly requesting, which can make them feel rejected or unwelcomed, or worse, stop requesting at all. Being on orange also pushes you to the very bottom of people's friends list.</p>
		
		<h2>Orange makes you antisocial.</h2>
        <p>Putting up an obstacle between you and others means you're missing out on chances to meet new people or reconnect with old ones. You're also missing out on different experiences and people that other users can offer you.</p>
		
		<h2>Orange ruins the spontaneity of VRChat.</h2>
		<p>You are creating a barrier for yourself and others to experience the unexpected and the unique that VRChat offers. You are also depriving yourself and others of the fun and excitement that comes from meeting outgoing people. (Most of whom never request off orange users)</p>
		
        <h2>Orange is not necessary.</h2>
        <p>There are many other ways to signal your availability and preserve your privacy. For example, you can set a custom status describing your availability, or create an Invite Only or Invite+ instance.</p>
		
		<h2>Orange makes you invisible and ignored.</h2>
		<p>You become just a name, always in a private world, at the bottom of people's friends list. No one sees what you're doing, where you are, or who you're with. Getting to know you or trying to join you eventually becomes more trouble or awkward than its worth, and you become yet another irrelevent, forgotten name taking up valuable space on people's social menu.</p>
		
		<br><h1 style="color: #666666; font-size: 50px;">What about these excuses?</h1><br>
		
		<h2>"I have multiple friend groups, and I don't want them mixing."</h2>
        <p>If you feel the need to compartmentalize your friends like that, you're better off creating multiple accounts, or using the group system and creating private group instances. That way, the friend group you want to hang out with will be able to freely join you, while those who aren't will see you in a private group instance. You can also introduce your friends to each other and find common ground or interests among them. You don't have to limit yourself to one friend group or exclude others from your social circle.</p>

		<h2>"Just request off me!"</h2>
		<p>When you're on orange, you're hiding what you're doing, who you're with, and where you are. People don't know if they will fit into their world or group, so requesting becomes a sort of risk. People want to know what you're up to before they annoy you with invite requests. Saying this is also bad for you too, because it can lead to constant requesting only for your invites to be ignored when your friend doesn't want to join your particular world.</p>

        <h2>"I'm erping!!"</h2>
        <p>You're not going to be accepting invites anyway, so why waste others' time by being on orange? Just go on red status to signal that you're busy and do not want to be disturbed.</p>
		
		<h2>"I don't want ______ to join because they're weird"</h2>
		<p>If someone upsets you enough that you actively avoid them, they're not your friend. Be an adult and discuss this with them, or unfriend them, instead of avoiding them and causing trouble for all your other real friends. You can also block or mute anyone who bothers you.</p>
		
		<h2>"I'm working on an avatar/world"</h2>
        <p>If you're working on your avatar in Unity and don't want to be disturbed or distracted by other users, you don't have to be on orange for that. You can set your status to red if you want to signal that you're busy or do not want to be bothered. You can also set your world access to Invite Only or Invite+ if you want to test your creations with specific people or keep them private until they're ready.</p>
		
		<h2>"I want to know who's joining me so I'm not startled"</h2>
        <p>You don't need orange status for this either! Enable join notifications to be notified when a friend joins your lobby on your HUD. That way there's no surprises.</p>
