        <br><br><h1 style="font-size: 60px;">🟠 No Orange!</h1>
        <p><b>Please don't use the orange status on VRChat.</b></p>
		<p>Instead, change your status to something more clear and respectful!</p><br>
		
		<h1 style="color: #333333; font-size: 45px;">Why does orange suck?</h1>

        <h2><strong>Orange does not signal your actual availability.</strong></h2>
        <p>It's confusing. Some people say orange means they're busy, while others use it as some sort of weird filter... who knows!  You could miss out on someone cool wanting to hang just because of a confusing status.</p>

        <h2>Orange wastes peoples' time.</h2>
        <p>It can make people repeatedly request invites, hoping you'll accept. They might even get invited but change their mind about joining, wasting their time and energy. It also makes them feel unwanted, just sitting there waiting for an invite that never comes.</p>

        <h2>Orange makes you unapproachable.</h2>
        <p>It gives off the vibe that you don't want to be bothered, even if that's not what you intend. Friends feel annoying for asking to join, and new ones won't even try. Plus, being orange puts you at the bottom of the friends list.</p>
		
		<h2>Orange makes you antisocial.</h2>
        <p>It puts up a barrier between you and others, causing you to miss out on meeting new people or reconnecting with old friends. You're missing different experiences and the chance to connect with other users.</p>
		
		<h2>Orange ruins the spontaneity of VRChat.</h2>
		<p>You are creating a barrier for yourself and others to experience the unexpected and the unique that VRChat offers. You are also depriving yourself and others of the fun and excitement that comes from meeting outgoing people. (Most of whom never request off orange users)</p>
		
        <h2>Orange is not necessary.</h2>
        <p>There are many other ways to signal your availability and preserve your privacy. For example, you can set a custom status describing your availability, or create an Invite Only or Invite+ instance.</p>
		
		<h2>Orange makes you invisible and ignored.</h2>
		<p>On orange, you're a forgotten name in a private world. Nobody knows what you're up to or wants to put in the effort to find out.</p>
		
		<br><h1 style="color: #666666; font-size: 50px;">What about these excuses?</h1><br>
		
		<h2>"I have multiple friend groups, and I don't want them mixing."</h2>
        <p>If you feel the need to compartmentalize your friends like that, you're better off creating multiple accounts, or using the group system and creating private group instances. That way, the friend group you want to hang out with will be able to freely join you, while those who aren't will see you in a private group instance. You can also introduce your friends to each other and find common ground or interests among them. You don't have to limit yourself to one friend group or exclude others from your social circle.</p>

		<h2>"Just request off me!"</h2>
		<p>When you're on orange, you're hiding what you're doing, who you're with, and where you are. People don't know if they will fit into their world or group, so requesting becomes a sort of risk. People want to know what you're up to before they annoy you with invite requests. Saying this is also bad for you too, because it can lead to constant requesting only for your invites to be ignored when your friend doesn't want to join your particular world.</p>

        <h2>"I'm erping!!"</h2>
        <p>You're not going to be accepting invites anyway, so why waste others' time by being on orange? Just go on red status to signal that you're busy and do not want to be disturbed.</p>
		
		<h2>"I don't want ______ to join because they're weird"</h2>
		<p>If someone upsets you enough that you actively avoid them, they're not your friend. Be an adult and discuss this with them, or unfriend them, instead of avoiding them and causing trouble for all your other real friends. You can also block or mute anyone who bothers you.</p>
		
		<h2>"I'm working on an avatar/world"</h2>
        <p>If you're working on your avatar in Unity and don't want to be disturbed or distracted by other users, you don't have to be on orange for that. You can set your status to red if you want to signal that you're busy or do not want to be bothered. You can also set your world access to Invite Only or Invite+ if you want to test your creations with specific people or keep them private until they're ready.</p>
		
		<h2>"I want to know who's joining me so I'm not startled"</h2>
        <p>You don't need orange status for this either! Enable join notifications to be notified when a friend joins your lobby on your HUD. That way there's no surprises.</p>
